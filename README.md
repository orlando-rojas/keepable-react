# Keepable

Frontend for Keepable React.

## Installation

This is a regular `create-react-app`, you can install all the packages with `yarn install`.

## Starting the App

You can start the app with `yarn start`.

## API

The API must be run locally. Rails runs on port 3000, so when using `yarn start`, the tool
will ask you if you want to use another port, which will be `port` 3001 automatically.

## Changes

The icons have been added as SVG and the logo as PNG.

## Tests

Sadly, there are no tests this time :sad-pepe: ðŸ˜ž
